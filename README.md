My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository. This project is where creativity meets caffeine and code. It’s built to showcase my work, experiments, and a few lines of code that somehow survived the first run.

## Getting Started

Before you dive in, make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed. I recommend using **nvm** because it saves you from version nightmares.

### Setup Instructions

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>

# 2. Move into the project folder
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# 3. Install dependencies (go grab a coffee, npm takes its time)
npm install

# 4. Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Now open the local URL shown in your terminal and enjoy watching your browser come alive with code that actually works.

## Tech Stack

This project is powered by a few of my favorite tools in the dev universe:

* **React** for dynamic UI magic
* **Vite** because waiting for builds is so 2019
* **TypeScript** to catch errors before they catch me
* **Tailwind CSS** for styling that doesn’t make me cry
* **shadcn/ui** for components that look good even before I touch them

## Editing and Customization

All your editable parts live in the `src/` directory. Tweak components, adjust styles, or break things responsibly. Use your favorite IDE (VS Code, WebStorm, or that one terminal editor you pretend to love) to make changes.

If something breaks, it’s probably a missing semicolon.

## Deployment

Once everything looks good locally, you can deploy it easily:

* Use **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **GitHub Pages** for a quick setup
* Or build a production version like a pro

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized files will appear in the `dist/` folder. Host them anywhere you like, preferably not on your cousin’s old laptop.

## Domain Setup

Got a fancy custom domain?
Just connect it through your hosting provider’s DNS settings and make your portfolio truly yours.

## Behind the Scenes

This portfolio started as a small side project to test out new frameworks, but like most side projects, it evolved into a full-blown late-night debugging saga.

I wanted something clean, fast, and easy to update without needing a PhD in CSS grid alignment. The layout is simple on purpose it keeps the focus on the work, not the background gradients.

I’ve spent more time picking the right font than writing actual content, but that’s just part of the dev aesthetic.

If you’re reading this and find a bug, it’s not a bug it’s a feature in disguise.
